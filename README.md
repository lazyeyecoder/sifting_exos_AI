## Project Overview

Sifting ExoS is a machine learning application that identifies whether a detected celestial body is a **confirmed exoplanet**, **candidate**, or **false positive**.  
It utilises **NASA‚Äôs Kepler Object of Interest (KOI)** dataset to analyse parameters such as flux ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, planet radius, impact parameter, and various false positive flags.

The model was trained using a **Random Forest Classifier**, achieving an accuracy of approximately **80%** after balancing and feature optimization.  
The project demonstrates how open NASA space data can be transformed into a user-friendly AI-powered application for exoplanet research.

## Features

- Predicts the **disposition** of a detected celestial object.  
- Displays the **probability distribution** for each class (Confirmed, Candidate, False Positive).  
- Provides a **data-driven reasoning** behind predictions.  
- Simple **Streamlit web interface** for live testing.
